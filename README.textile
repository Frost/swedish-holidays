Some ruby code for calculating swedish holidays.

This list of holidays will include de facto (half and full) holidays as well as public holidays. 

This means that midsummers eve will be listed as a holiday, as well as new years eve and christmas eve, maundy thursday (sk√§rtorsdagen) and a few others. Full list "here":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holidays_in_Sweden#De_facto_full_holidays_.28.22Helgdag.22.29

"holidays":http://github.com/alexdunae/holidays seems nice, but it doesn't seem to include de facto holidays.
